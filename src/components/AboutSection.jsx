			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a passionate full-stack developer dedicated to creating
				modern, user-friendly websites and applications. My expertise
				spans across front-end and back-end technologies, including
				HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I thrive on
				turning complex ideas into seamless digital experiences through
				clean and efficient code. In addition to development, I
				collaborate closely with design teams and have experience
				working with Figma, which helps bridge the gap between design
				and functionality. Whether it's crafting responsive interfaces
				or building robust server-side logic, I am committed to
				delivering high-quality, scalable solutions tailored to meet
